Execution method
I have used Visual studio for the development of this project. The executable can be run as is on desktop. On laptop,
ensure that your graphics card is running discretely. The executable can be found in the x64 folder.

Shortcuts 
“G” – Gaussian blur effect on screen.
“X” – Stops the camera auto moving. 
“Z” – Switches the screen to the spit screen implementation.

Both the gaussian effect and the split screen can be deactivated through clicking the respective key binds again.

Here is a Youtube link to a reel of the project.

Regarding the areas I struggled with in this project, considering it was my first time utilizing the opengl library
for graphics, I found the documentation as well as the wide range of function calls intimidating. Specific areas I
struggled with were the use of deferred rendering, scene nodes and post processing. 

I would like the focus of this project to be the animated mob that moves around accompanied by the lighting and 
post processing effect available as large amounts of time went into these aspects. The numerous use of buffers 
really challenged me when developing the lighting and post processing. The use of skeletol animation accompanied 
by understanding how textures work was also a challengin aspect of the project that i would like to focus to be 
upon.

The openGL library was used accompanied by functions and classes coded alongside my professors notes. I would like 
for the renderer of this project to be looked at as that was done solely by me, with reference to my lecture notes.
Pls consider only the files inside the 'Blank Project' file. The rest of the files, including the nclgl library were
provided by my professor.
